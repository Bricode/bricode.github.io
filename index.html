      Warhammer 40,000 is a miniature wargame produced by Games Workshop. The
      first edition of the rulebook was published in September 1987. The latest
      edition is the eighth, which was published in June 2017. Warhammer 40,000
      is the most popular miniature wargame in the world it is most popular in
      Britain. As in other miniature wargames, players enact a battle using
      miniature models of warriors and fighting vehicles (effectively toy
      soldiers). The playing area is a tabletop model of a battlefield,
      comprising models of buildings, hills, trees, and other terrain features.
      Players take turns to move their model warriors around the battlefield and
      pretend that they are fighting the other player's warriors. These
      imaginary fights are resolved using dice and simple arithmetic.
