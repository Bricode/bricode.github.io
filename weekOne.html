        <h2>Session One 21/07/2020</h2>
        <h2>
            What did you do in that thirty minutes
        </h2>
        <p>
            I started working through the suggested Laravel tutorial, as I have no experience with Laravel.
            I had some issues understanding the install process for php, but once I releaised that laragon didnt need any additional installs, the process went quite smoothly.
            I coordinated with my team members to set up a messenger chat group, We chose messenger intially as it will provide easy quick messenging, 
            although I dont know how much use it will get.
            I tried to get an idea on how the group dynamic will function, But I think that will need more time and doing actual work together to find out more.
        </p>        
        <h2>
            What did you learn from this session
        </h2>
        <p>
            Today we covered the agile methodology, I was familiar with the ideas in concept, due to my current working experience using a kanbad board as a software tester 
            so I knew what the end result of an agile workflow looked like
            , but I hadnt looked into what the actual principles of agile were.
            I found them to be fairly straight forward, 
            ideas like be prepared for change and communicate frequently with the client seem to be quite common sense as it would be 
            incredibly difficult to provide a satisfactory product without communication to the client.

        <h2>Sesion Two</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>In this class, We did the initial set up of our github repositorie, how branches should be set up and how to use the built in git workflow page.
            We were then tasked with making a simple crud app in laravel as a team. I placed the intial laravel folder structure into the repo, 
            but didnt get started on the web page's actual development as the rest of the class was spent trying to find out why the pulled repo wasnt working on my team mates computers.
        </p>
        <h3>Problems faced</h3>
        <p>The major problem I faced today was the pulled repo not working on my other team mates computers. 
            I traced the problem after some trouble shooting to be to do with the included git ignore. 
            I knew that this was a problem that would need to be solved now before we started any further work as it would come up again as an issue</p>
        <h3>Things I learnt</h3>
        <p>Through this problem, I learnt about the role of composer and How it affects a laravel app, 
            I also learnt that I would need to watch some more of the laravel material before I next had to develop for it as I had no idea how to integrate the mysql elements into a webpage</p>
        <h3>Next steps</h3>  
        <P> Finish a large chunk of the laravel tutorial videos, Get my home set up working to enable easier workflow. Prepare for the client interview</P>
