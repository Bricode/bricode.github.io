            What did you do in that thirty minutes
        </h2>
        <p>
            I started working through the suggested Laravel tutorial, as I have no experience with Laravel.
            I had some issues understanding the install process for php, but once I releaised that laragon didnt need any additional installs, the process went quite smoothly.
            I coordinated with my team members to set up a messenger chat group, We chose messenger intially as it will provide easy quick messenging, 
            although I dont know how much use it will get.
            I tried to get an idea on how the group dynamic will function, But I think that will need more time and doing actual work together to find out more.

        <h2>
            What did you learn from this session
        </h2>
        <p>
            Today we covered the agile methodology, I was familiar with the ideas in concept, due to my current working experience using jira as a software tester
            , but I hadnt looked into what the actual principles of agile were.
            I found them to be fairly straight forward, 
            ideas like be prepared for change and communicate frequently with the client seem to be quite common sense as it would be 
            incredibly difficult to provide a satisfactory product without communication to the client.
