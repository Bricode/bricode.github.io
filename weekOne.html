            I started working through the suggested laravel tutorial, as I have no experience with laravel. 
            I also coordinated with my team members to set up a messenger and teams chat group

        <p>
            Today we covered the agile methodology, I was familiar with the ideas in concept, due to my current working experience using jira as a software tester
            , but I hadnt looked into what the actual principles of agile were.
