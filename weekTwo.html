    >what have you completed since the last meeting?
    </h1>
    <p>Since last meeting, I have completed up to the tenth of the laracasts tutorials, I also trouble shot why the laravel repo wasnt working on others computers</p>
    <h1>
        what do you plan to complete by the next meeting?
    </h1>
    <p>I want to get ten more tutorials completed by next class</p>
    <h1>
        what is getting in your way
    </h1>
    <p>Time will be the major factor getting in my way this week, as I wont be able to do work this weekend so I need to get as much done with the limited time as possible</p>
	
    <h1> end of week progress report</h1>
    <p>I did not get any of my planned work finished, as I had other commitments that took most of my time, 
        I dont think this will continue to be a problem as I have now gotten a handle on my timetable.
    </br>
    Today we covered the intial user stories we were going to implement for the project, I primarily wrote the user stories down and then we discussed the priority of each user story.</p>
