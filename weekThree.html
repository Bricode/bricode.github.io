    <h1>In class session one</h1>
    <p>In this class, we started our first sprint of this project, I was given three user stories, all revolving around logging in. 
        I have registering an account, logging in and logging out to work on. I started researching laravel authentication dependencies.
    
    Since the last session, I had completed up to tutorial 19 of the laracasts videos, I am aiming to have 25 finished by the end of the week, 
    as I will need to know how to create a form to submit user data to the server for registering an account.

As a group we decided that we would have one of our scrum meetings tomorrow, this will be more useful later into the sprint, once I have had the chance to do more work.</p>

<h1>First scrum meeting</h1>
<p>What have I completed since the last meeting?
    since the last meeting, I have further research the authentication dependencies I was looking at on tuesday, 
    I also completed one more tutorial and got the branch set up on my home system.

    <h3>What would I like to complete by next meeting?</h3>
    I aim to have completed the form to register a new user, this will leave with all of next week to cover the logging in and logging out functionality

    <h3>What will be the biggest block preventing me from completing this?</h3>
    Likely just time, as the second half of my week is typically the most busy side of my week, but I will try to get the work finished for next meeting
