    <h1>Week Four</h1>
    <p>This was an interupted week 
        as we didnt get to meet up for our regularly scheduled
         meeting due to covid cancelling in person classes for that day
        , instead we communicated through text channels about work being done. 
        The potential for lock down restrictions once again is slightly concerning for me 
        as I wonder what affect that might have on our productivity as a group, 
        but I will just have to adapt as the circumstances change.
    </p>
    <h1>What did I get completed this week?</h1>
    <p>This week I did not very much work, as the majority of my tasks were completed last week. 
        I updated the user sign in to allow for usernames instead of emails, to fit with the customers specifications.
    I added the date of birth field to user registration and added the appriate field to the migration so that it will be passed to the database.
    </p>
    <h1>Friday planned work</h1>
    <p>Today, I plan to get the groups work merged into one branch, this will bring together the sprint so that we can present the work to the client next week. 
        While I intially thought this would just be merging on github, I underestiated how much work would need to be done to bring all of the groups work together. 
        for example, linking my logging in and out work to the navigation bar that was made. 
        So while all of these functions were implemented in the code, they were not in their finished places. This will likely be my job for the next sprint</p>
