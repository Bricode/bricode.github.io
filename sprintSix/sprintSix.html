<h1>Sprint Six</h1>
<h3>Technical Achievements</h3>
<h4>Heroku Hosting, PostgresSQL</h4>
<p>My task for this sprint was the live hosting of our project. 
    This was a two stage process, first the hosting, then setting up the config for PostgresSQL.
    This project was time sensitive as I wanted the intial hosting completed as soon as possible to give us plenty of time to push the changes up to the live version.
    While I had done some heroku hosting before, this was my first time hosting a laravel app and so there was some learning required around that.
