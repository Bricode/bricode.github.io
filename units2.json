In the case of strike forces bolstered by Primaris battle-brothers, this role is fulfilled by the Intercessor Squads. Capable of levelling overlapping salvoes of firepower, these squads often form the flexible fighting core of newly-founded Primaris Chapters – though of course many established Chapters have eagerly leveraged their abilities, fielding them alongside Tactical Squads.",

They hit the enemy in one sudden and overwhelming blow, leaving them reeling as follow-up waves of Space Marines drive home the attack. Equipped with jump packs and reinforced armour, Inceptors can be dropped from the very edge of a planet’s atmospheric envelope, weaving and twisting through the skies before slamming down into the enemy’s midst.",

        "flavorText": "Imperial observers have likened the fire of a Hellblaster Squad to the incinerating power of a stellar flare. Bolt after bolt of plasma sears across the battlefield; those caught in the Hellblasters’ sights are swiftly annihilated, their armour blasted to ash and their flesh and bone to glowing motes. Even armoured fighting vehicles are swiftly reduced to heaps of metallic slag. Deployed at the correct point and time, a single Hellblaster Squad can blunt the thundering assault of an armoured spearhead, or lay low even the most titanic alien fiend.",
