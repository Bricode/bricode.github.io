Technical Achievements
-Game genres and searching
    This sprint I had to learn two different but 
    connected aspects of the project, eloquent and mariadb.
    Mariadb was needed as I had to be able to see if the genres I had added to the games migration had actually 
    come through to the database. 

    Eloquent was a new skill I needed to learn as 
    I hadnt previously worked with migrations or eloquent sql.
