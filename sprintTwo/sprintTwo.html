<h1>Sprint Two</h1>
<h3>Technical Achievements</h3> 
<h4>-Game genres and sorting</h4>
<p>
    For this sprint I was in charge of implementing the games genre systems as well as searching and displaying games based on their genres
</br>
</p>
    To implement the games genres, I had to learn two different but connected aspects of the project, eloquent and mariadb phpmyadmin.

    Mariadb was the server that needed to be connected to. I had only used it for sql and not php which presented some new learning opportunitys 
    Mariadb was needed as I had to be able to see if the genres I had added to the games migration had actually 
    come through to the database. I was told by a team member how to link my local laravel work to the mariadb database,
    so there wasnt much individual learning needed for this. While this isn't our final planned database, I still found it interesting to learn about.

    Eloquent was a new skill I needed to learn as while I was expierenced at creating tables in sqlite,
    there were some major differences in the syntax used in eloquent.

    I used it to create the migration that made the genre table within the database, this then links to each game as a foreign key.
</p>
</br>
    <h4>-Searching based on genre</h4>
    <p>
    This was a simple story to work through, as the bulk of the work for it was already finished. Having completed the migration and database setup,
    all that was needed to do to complete this was to link the genre as a foreign key to the games table and then add it to the html template used to render each game.

    <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
    <h4>What did I do well this sprint?</h4>
    <p>I think my communication for this sprint was done well. As I was the scrum leader for this sprint, 
        I decided that I would work hard to send out messages regularly to my team members
         both to keep my self working as well as encourage my team members to get their work finished before the deadline so we could merge.
        I think this helped our team keep ourselves accountable to the amount of work we were completing. Sending out messages online regularly was also needed more this week as we had dales day 
        so we missed an inclass meeting.</p>
    </br>
    <h4>What could I have done better?</h4>
    <p>
        On the first day of the sprint, when we were given the tasks to complete for this sprint, as sprint leader I was supposed to assign each team member their storys for the sprint. However because some team members decided to pack up early, I put off assigning tasks untill our next meeting.
        I view this as a failing on my part, because as the sprint leader, I hampered my team mates abilities to start on their tasks as soon as possible. This might have been a reason as too why we had three user stories not finished by the end of the sprint. I take responsibility for this happening,
         and in future, I aim to get any of my administrative tasks finished as quickly as possible to not prevent my team mates from doing work.
    </p>
    <h4>What lessons did I learn?</h4>
    <p>
        As I stated in the what I could have done better section, 
        I learned a lesson about priorities. 
        I found out that I should always prioritize tasks that will enable my teammates to do their work,
         this means that we will always be able to get our work finished as soon as possible without any slow downs.
    </p>
    <h4>What barriers did I encounter?</h4>
    <p>I think the only barrier I encountered this sprint was continuing to finish tasks before the last few days of a sprint. 
        If I judge that I can get my tasks finished by the deadline, I tend to leave them to the shortest amount of time that the can be completed in. 
        This is a barrier I will have to work to overcome in future.
