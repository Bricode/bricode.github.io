<h1>Sprint Two</h1>
<h3>Technical Achievements</h3> 
<h4>-Game genres and sorting</h4>
<p>
    For this sprint I was in charge of implementing the games genre systems as well as searching and displaying games based on their genres
</br>
    To implement the games genres, I had to learn two different but connected aspects of the project, eloquent and mariadb phpmyadmin.

    Mariadb was the server that needed to be connected to. I had only used it for sql and not php which presented some new learning opportunitys 
    Mariadb was needed as I had to be able to see if the genres I had added to the games migration had actually 
    come through to the database. I was told by a team member how to link my local laravel work to the mariadb database,
    so there wasnt much individual learning needed for this. While this isn't our final planned database, I still found it interesting to learn about.

    Eloquent was a new skill I needed to learn as while I was expierenced at creating tables in sqlite,
    there were some major differences in the syntax used in eloquent.

    I used it to create the migration that made the genre table within the database, this then links to each game as a foreign key.

    -Searching based on genre
    This was a simple story to work through, as the bulk of the work for it was already finished. Having completed the migration and database setup,
    all that was needed to do to complete this was to link the genre as a foreign key to the games table and then add it to the html template used to render each game
