<h1>Sprint Two</h1>
<h3>Technical Achievements</h3> 
<h4>-Game genres and sorting</h4>
<p>
    For this sprint I was in charge of implementing the games genre systems as well as searching and displaying games based on their genres
</br>
    This sprint I had to learn two different but connected aspects of the project, eloquent and mariadb.

    Mariadb was the 
    Mariadb was needed as I had to be able to see if the genres I had added to the games migration had actually 
    come through to the database. I was told by a team member how to link my local laravel work to the mariadb database,
    so there wasnt much individual learning needed for this.

    Eloquent was a new skill I needed to learn as while I was expierenced at creating tables in sql,
    I hadnt previously worked with eloquent sql.
