<h1>Sprint Five</h1>
<h3>Technical Achievements</h3>
<h4>Social Media Sharing</h4>
<p>I was only given one user story to finish for this sprint, this was the social media sharing features.
    In order to implement this feature, I made use of a laravel dependency called laravel-share. 
    This wasn't the first option I investigated implementing, as I attempted to implement it with a dependency called social-share and then a cdn link.
    but I struggled to get it working with the way we had designed our current website as from my understanding, it wanted to be called in the routes of laravel app, 
    and another function was already being called. The cdn link worked to import the icons for each website, but it would only take the user to the home page of each social media site, 
    and you couldnt provide a link to the current users page. I then found laravel-share which could be called from with the template and you could provide a link to the current page in the method call. 
    This was far better for our purposes.

    Personal reflection
    </h3>
    <p>This sprint was quite hectic as I had two assignment hand in's in other classes that called for the majority of my attention. Because of this, software engineering was largely put on the back burner, 
        untill I had completed at least one of my other classes assignments</p>
        <h4>What did I do well?</h4>
        <p>I succesfully implemented what I learnt from the previous sprint, 
            if I hadn't decided to cut my loses and move onto investigating other ways 
            of implementing then I would likely have run out of time given my other pressing deadlines.
            It is quite satisfying identifying a problem in previous sprints and then implementing it succesfully in later sprints.
        </p>
        <h4>What could I have done better?</h4>
        <p>I feel that my technical contributions this sprint was lacking. While I completed all the tasks I was assigned, 
            only doing one task for the entire sprint feels disappointing. I'm unsure how I could have improved on this given my schedule for this sprint, 
            but I will need to remember this feeling as we come into the final sprint as I need to keep pace to finish strong and not putter out.</p>
