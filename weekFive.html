    <h1>Post sprint one reflection</h1>
    <h2> Group reflection </h2>
    <p>What worked well?
        Independently worked efficiently, we had a functional product to show the client, majority of tasks were completed and communication was good
    </br>
        What could be improved?
        Merging earlier to give us more time to fix merging conflicts to make work cohesive. Could of made more merges to the master instead of one big one at the end of the sprint
    </br>
        What will we commit to doing in the next Sprint?
        Continuing good communication, completing tasks in decent time frames and not straying off path from what the client envisions.</p>
    <h2>Individual reflection</h2>
    <p>What worked well for me?
        I got my work finished quickly, as I had most of my tasks finished by the first week of the sprint. I'll continue this later in the what could be improved. 
        I think I was a good team member, I helped with technical problems that my team mates had, and attended all of our meetings in person. 
    </p>
    <p> What could I have improved?
        I could have done more in the last week, Once I had finished my tasks I didnt strive to get anything else finished such as merges that would have made for a more cohesive friday session, since I knew that the nav bar had been finished for several days. 
        this would have made the presentation to client go smoother.
    </p>
    <p>What do I commit to doing next sprint?</p>
    <p>Now that I have a better grasp on the flow of a sprint, I will aim to get my code reviewed earlier and merged so that it can be made to all work together smoother.</p>

    <h1> Sprint 2 start </h1>
    <p>I have been given two tasks to complete for this sprint,
        Integrate my existing authentication code into the project, this will mostly focus around the nav bar and loading the user information into the nav bar to display.
        I will also be working on the sorting games feature on the games page, these will be sorting by number of highscores etc. I want to get the authentication done in the first week of sprint and the sorting done in the second
    </p>

    <h1>Group meeting</h1>
    <p>The next group meeting was held on the wednesday after the sprint started, 
        I had finished the logging in and logging out final implementation, we decided that my work should be merged into the master branch as I had some bug fixes included.
    </p> 
    <h1>Session Two</h1>
    <p>There wasn't an inclass session due to dales day, and I decided that given my work earlier in the week that I would take the weekend off from this project</p>
