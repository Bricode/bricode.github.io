<h1>Agile end of project Reflection</h1>
<h2>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software 25/08/2020.</h2>
<p>At the end of every sprint, there was a meeting held where we would show the client and class mates our project as it currently stood. As a group, we aimed to have all features finished and functional for this meeting. 
In this way we aimed to deliver constant valuable software, as the product would always be in a working state with new features.
As an individual, I ensured that all user stories asigned to me were fully functional for a presentation to the client. 
This principle helped keep me accountable and focused becuase the two week looming deadline meant that I had to priorities and not put off doing work after the alotted time.
I think this principle was most useful as a driving force after the topic change, as while we lost alot of motivation to work on the software, we still had deadlines to finish features and so we kept working.</p>
</br>
<h2>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.</h2>
<p>This was the weakest of the agile principles for both me and my group. When this project was started, we were very happy working on features and bringing them up to a high standard. 
At the start of sprint four when we were told that we would be changing topic, we did not welcome the change as it felt terrible having several features that had lots of effort and time put in be deprecated so suddenly. 
This had a noticable effect both on team morale and the rate at which we worked on features. If I was to have another run at this project with the hindsight I now have, This would be the principle I would aim to improve on.
I dont think I did enough to encourage my team and myself to pick ourselves back up and accept that the change had happened.
</p>
<h2>Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</h2>
<p>I fulfilled this principle across the entire project by ensuring that my features where always completed before the client presentation. 
    As a team, we accomplished this by always presenting a fully functioning product, 
    this would sometimes have an affect on things like the aesthitic of the website, but by sacrificing how it looked to always have the features completed and presented, we better fulfilled this agile principle</p>
</br>
<h2>Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</h2>
<p>This principle didnt have a major effect on our project development,
     as we werent developing a product that is profit driven. 
     We did have frequent communication between the team and the client, 
     but as there weren't any business people involved this was difficult to implement.</p>
</br>
<h2>Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.</h2>
<p>I implmented this agile principle in one major way. When I was sprint leader, before I would assign out the user stories for the sprint, 
    I would ask each of my team members if there were any of the stories that they wanted to do the most. If they had a story they were passionate about wanting to complete, 
    I would assign them it along with any tickets were in a similar scope.</p>
</br>
<h2>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.</h2>
<p>We implemented this by having a face to face meeting as a team every week, 
    this meant that we would meet in person around six times a week including classes. 
    This allowed us to keep a track of any issues people were having with implementation, 
    and find out how each team member was progressing. I think that these face to face meetings were an important part of maintaining pace, 
    particularly after the change of topic brought down group morale</p>
</br>
<h2>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</h2>
<p>Because we had to display our work every second tuesday, not only to the client but also to my classmates. 
    This was a form of motivation to provide a working software each week and the light ribbing from classmates 
    if your features didnt work meant that features would always be presented working and new features developed to maintain pace with the others.
</p>
</br>
<h2>Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</h2>
<p>When creating the tasks for each sprints, 
    as a team we aimed to keep each task a similar amount of work to implement or if that wasnt possible, 
    who ever was assigned the task that couldn't be made into a similar amount of work, 
    would be given less tasks to complete for the sprint so as to keep the workload even across the entire project.
    This meant that we could get a consistent pace as well as ensure that each team member could track how much time they were likely to need to complete their remaining tasks, 
    based on their previous sprints.</p>
</br>
<h2>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</h2>
<p>When I would do work on this project, I would implement good code practices like file hieracy, and laying out code on page so that it is easily understandable.
    This aided our agility as it meant that if any other members of team needed to use or change my code, it followed the standard conventions that they were used too.

</p>
</br>
<h2>Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.</h2>
<p> In this project, where possible I would use existing depedencys to accomplish tasks. This meant that I wouldn't have to spend lots of time making new code. 
    This also meant that finding examples for code implementation was easier as I didnt have to rely on stack overflow exclusivly to trouble shoot.
    This meant that for most of my tickets, I was minimising the amount of effort and work neededMade use of existing laravel authentication modules to not have to reinvent the wheel, saving a lot of time in development</p>
</br>
<h2>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</h2>
<p>We had a loose team structure, where each sprint a different person would be the sprint leader, they would be in charge of organizing the meeting with the client and assigning the team members user stories to work through for the sprint.
    As a team, we didnt have an overall team leader, but I would follow up with my team members regularly, be that in other shared classes or by sending messages, 
    just to check that they werent having any major problems and were sucessfully implementing code before the deadline. I like to think this helped the team maintain our pace as well, and keep work being finished.
    This wasnt a role that we verabally decided on me having, but I think helped us particularly when team morale was down after the topic change.
</p>
</br>
<h2>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</h2>
<p>At the end of each sprint, we would reflect on what went well, what we could have done better, and what we committed to doing in the next sprint.
    Something that we noticed at the start of the project that we did well was communication and this was something we aimed to keep up through out the entire project, 
    I think we did this for the entirety of the project and so this was an example of something we noticed we did well and kept at.
    An example of reflecting on how to be more effective that we implemented succesfully was that early on we noticed we needed to merge earlier to prevent stress on the day of presentation. This took us a few sprints to get the hang of but we succesfully implemented it in both sprints five and sprints six.
    We did identify a problem that we never really addressed, that was team morale after the topic change. At the end of sprint four, we recognized that we were feeling unmotivated but we never took any major steps to solve this problem.
