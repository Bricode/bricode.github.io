<h1>Agile end of project Reflection</h1>
<h2>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software 25/08/2020.</h2>
<p>At the end of every sprint, there was a meeting held where we would show the client and class mates our project as it currently stood. As a group, we aimed to have all features finished and functional for this meeting. 
In this way we aimed to deliver constant valuable software, as the product would always be in a working state with new features.
As an individual, I ensured that all user stories asigned to me were fully functional for a presentation to the client. 
This principle helped keep me accountable and focused becuase the two week looming deadline meant that I had to priorities and not put off doing work after the alotted time.
I think this principle was most useful as a driving force after the topic change, as while we lost alot of motivation to work on the software, we still had deadlines to finish features and so we kept working.</p>
</br>
<h2>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.</h2>
<p>This was the weakest of the agile principles for both me and my group. When this project was started, we were very happy working on features and bringing them up to a high standard. 
At the start of sprint four when we were told that we would be changing topic, we did not welcome the change as it felt terrible having several features that had lots of effort and time put in be deprecated so suddenly. 
This had a noticable effect both on team morale and the rate at which we worked on features. If I was to have another run at this project with the hindsight I now have, This would be the principle I would aim to improve on.
I dont think I did enough to encourage my team and myself to pick ourselves back up and accept that the change had happened.
</p>
<h2>Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</h2>
<p>I fulfilled this principle across the entire project by ensuring that my features where always completed before the client presentation. 
    As a team, we accomplished this by always presenting a fully functioning product, 
    this would sometimes have an affect on things like the aesthitic of the website, but by sacrificing how it looked to always have the features completed and presented, we better fulfilled this agile principle</p>
</br>
<h2>Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</h2>
<p>This principle didnt have a major effect on our project development,
     as we werent developing a product that is profit driven. 
     We did have frequent communication between the team and the client, 
     but as there weren't any business people involved this was difficult to implement.</p>
</br>
<h2>Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.</h2>
<p>I implmented this agile principle in one major way. When I was sprint leader, before I would assign out the user stories for the sprint, 
    I would ask each of my team members if there were any of the stories that they wanted to do the most. If they had a story they were passionate about wanting to complete, 
    I would assign them it along with any tickets were in a similar scope.</p>
</br>
<h2>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.</h2>
<p>We implemented this by having a face to face meeting as a team every week, 
    this meant that we would meet in person around six times a week including classes. 
    This allowed us to keep a track of any issues people were having with implementation, 
    and find out how each team member was progressing. I think that these face to face meetings were an important part of maintaining pace, 
    particularly after the change of topic brought down group morale</p>
</br>
<h2>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</h2>
<p>Because we had to display our work every second tuesday, not only to the client but also to my classmates. 
    This was a form of motivation to provide a working software each week and the light ribbing from classmates 
    if your features didnt work meant that features would always be presented working and new features developed to maintain pace with the others.
</p>
</br>
<h2>Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</h2>
<p>small short tasks and end dates for tasks in the form of sprints helped keep development moving and possible.</p>
</br>
<h2>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</h2>
<p>
</br>
<h2>Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.</h2>
<p> Made use of existing laravel authentication modules to not have to reinvent the wheel, saving a lot of time in development</p>
</br>
<h2>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</h2>
<p>Group roles developed naturally</p>
</br>
<h2>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</h2>
<p>Weekly meetings out of class, plenty of communication through internet and in class</p>
<p>We held our first post sprint reflection, There weren't major group dynamic problems I identified over the first sprint, but we did note that assigning members tasks that are in similar </p>
