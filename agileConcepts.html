<h1>How did I implement each of the principles of the Agile Manifesto</h1>
<h2>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software 25/08/2020.</h2>
<p>we would present our working application every two weeks to the client, I ensured that my code portions were fully functional for a presentation</p>
<h2>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.</h2>
<p>[this will expand as I continue to work on the application, currently the client hasnt requested changes to the requirements as we havent had enough implemented for changes to be required 25/08/2020]</p>
<h2>Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</h2>
<p>two week long sprints, showing code to client</p>
</br>
<h2>Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</h2>
<p>regular client meetings at the start of each sprint</p>
</br>
<h2>Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.</h2>
</br>
<h2>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.</h2>
<p>weekly face to face meetings outside of class, client meeting at the start of each sprint</p>
</br>
<h2>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</h2>
<p>tuesday display days force working progress and encourage development as peers are viewing product</p>
</br>
<h2>Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</h2>
<p>small short tasks and end dates for tasks in the form of sprints helped keep development moving and possible.</p>
</br>
<h2>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</h2>
<p>
</br>
<h2>Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.</h2>
<p> Made use of existing laravel authentication modules to not have to reinvent the wheel, saving a lot of time in development</p>
</br>
<h2>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</h2>
<p>Group roles developed naturally</p>
</br>
<h2>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</h2>
<p>Weekly meetings out of class, plenty of communication through internet and in class</p>
<p>We held our first post sprint reflection, There weren't major group dynamic problems I identified over the first sprint, but we did note that assigning members tasks that are in similar </p>
