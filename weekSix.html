<h2>
    What did I do this week?
</h2>
<p>I finished the migration for my genre table and I linked the table to the games migration. 
    This then allowed me to implement my code to sort the displayed games of a selected genre.
    This meant I finished my assigned tasks for this sprint.

    Sprint reflection:
    I think I need to be more efficient with my time, 
    If I had finished my tasks earlier than the end of the sprint then I could have helped my team members finish as well, 
    leaving less tasks to roll over to the next sprint.

    My communication has been good this sprint, for example I send the group chat progress updates of my features, in order to give my team members an idea of what I am doing,
    and to help encourage my team to also continue and share their progress.
